# Communicate Data Findings - Fligth Data Final Project

This project is the final project for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.

## Installation

The following packages are necessary to correctly run/view this project:
Seaborn
MatplotLib
Numpy
Pandas
Datetime

## Usage

This project is specifically designed to examine Flight data (one of the recommended data options)
for the final data visualization portion the Data Analyst Nanodegree. 
The exploratory analysis focuses on flight data from 1988 and 2007 and further wrangled it to examine only flights to and from Pittsburgh, PA.
The explanatory analysis examines only delayed flights to and from Pittsburgh in 2007.
The data can be found by following this URL https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7
and downloading the 1988 and 2007 databases. 
These choices were made related to the Analyst/Author's personal investment in these years and the city.
