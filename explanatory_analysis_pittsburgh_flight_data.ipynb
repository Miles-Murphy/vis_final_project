The previous analysis focused on understand the basic nature of the flight data and then focusing in on flight data in Pittsburgh, PA in the years 1988 and 2007. This years are arbitrarily chosen from a data perspective, but are very important to the analyst's life as they are the year of his birth in Pittsburgh and the year he left Pittsburgh as an 18 year old \"adult\". \n",

The following exploratory analysis will look at some basic features of this dataframe with univariate analysis and then expand upon those features with bivariate or multivariate figures. "
